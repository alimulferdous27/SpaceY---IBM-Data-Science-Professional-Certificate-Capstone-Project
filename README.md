# SpaceY---IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
Space Y would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Musk. Your job is to determine the price of each launch. You will gather information about Space X and create dashboards for your team. You will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, you will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
